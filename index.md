## Story

Every year in Japan, being the manufacturing country, produces tons and tons of consumer needs like clothings,
electronics and car spare parts, etc.
New products replaced old ones every year and second hand markets are big in Japan.


The founders were always inspired to help the world green and clean and are volunteers of many social clubs in Tokyo 
(cleaning the river banks off plastics, etc.).
Ba Kyaw, one of the founders, went to Miyashita park of Shibuya,Tokyo one summer day and found an activity with a big pile of clothes.
It said 2 tons of clothes are produced per minute in the world.
Let alone other daily items, clothing itself consumes more energies and it's a serious problems in developed countries like Japan.
Energy is used not only in manufacturing but also in disposing the products.

 
When Ba Kyaw met Win, he shared and discussed about this and both agreed to start a B2B business to export Japanese used products
to developing countries.
Though, we can't stop the world demands for manufacturing, we would be able to reduce energy consumptions and environmental cleanliness
in disposing used products from Japan by distributing them to where it can be recycled in various ways.
